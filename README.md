## Introduction
This project explores three analysis methods for predicting the depth of anesthesia using EEG signals: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Machine Learning, and Machine Learning with additional parameters. The goal is to evaluate and compare these methods to enhance patient safety during surgical procedures by providing real-time monitoring of anesthesia depth.

## Model Framework (This is generated by ChatGPT, just paste yours contents...)
### 1. ANOVA
- **Input/Output Mechanisms:** The model uses raw EEG data as input and provides statistical results as output. The input consists of EEG signals recorded at a high sampling frequency, while the output includes ANOVA statistical metrics such as F-values and P-values, which indicate the significance of differences between experimental conditions.
- **Data Segmentation Methods:** The data is segmented into different experimental conditions based on the BIS (Bispectral Index) sampling period of 5 seconds. This means that every 5-second segment of the EEG data corresponds to one BIS data point. Given the EEG sampling frequency of 128 points per second, each segment contains 640 EEG data points. This segmentation aligns the EEG data with the BIS sampling periods, enabling meaningful statistical comparison.
- **Analysis Method:** The model applies ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine significant differences between different conditions. This statistical method tests whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of independent (unrelated) groups. By comparing the variances within and between groups, ANOVA helps in identifying whether the observed differences are greater than what might be expected due to random variation alone.

### 2. Machine Learning
- **Input/Output Mechanisms:** Uses preprocessed EEG data as input and provides classification results as output.
- **Signal Preprocessing Techniques:** Bandpass filtering, artifact removal.
- **Data Segmentation Methods:** Segments data into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Extraction Approaches:** Extracts time-domain and frequency-domain features.
- **Machine Learning Models Utilized:** SVM, Random Forest, and KNN.
- **Validation:** Cross-validation to assess model performance.

### 3. Machine Learning (More Parameters)
- **Input/Output Mechanisms:** Similar to the basic machine learning approach but with additional features and hyperparameters.
- **Signal Preprocessing Techniques:** Advanced filtering techniques and more sophisticated artifact removal.
- **Data Segmentation Methods:** Optimized segmentation based on more criteria.
- **Feature Extraction Approaches:** Includes non-linear features and more detailed frequency components.
- **Machine Learning Models Utilized:** Includes deep learning models like CNN and LSTM.
- **Validation:** Hyperparameter tuning and extensive cross-validation.

## Validation
- **ANOVA:** Validated through F-tests and p-value analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Performance validated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Machine Learning (More Parameters):** Additional validation through ROC curves and confusion matrices.
